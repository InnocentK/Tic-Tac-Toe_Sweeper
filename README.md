# Tic-Tac-Toe_Sweeper
This program is a combination of two well-known board games: Tic-Tac-Toe and Minesweeper.

The game plays like normal tic-tac-toe where two players pick positions on a board to see who can get the most markers in a row. In addition at the beginning of the game both players set mines on the board and if the opposing player hits their mine it is a game over.

Additionally this game supports multiple board sizes to play on (3x3, 4x4, 5x5).

This game also has a debug mode (currently only fully works for the 3x3 board) that allows you to get a more in-depth look on how the game is operating as you play.
